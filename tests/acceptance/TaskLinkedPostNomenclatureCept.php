In Cacbot, we have "Anchor Posts" and "Linked Posts". The AI Plugin custom post type is a set as an Anchor Post.

Each task that is performed is stored as a linked post pointing to the Ai Plugin CPT.

Once the task is performed, the comments are closed on the linked post.

To initiate a new task, the user should click "New" in the frontend.
